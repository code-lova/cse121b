# Weather Forecast Application

A simple weather forecast application built with JavaScript, ES modules, and the Fetch API.

## Features

- Interacts with the DOM of an HTML document.
- Uses ES modules for structured code.
- Includes conditional branching for input validation.
- Exclusively uses template literals when building strings.
- Utilizes the Fetch API to consume external weather data delivered in JSON format.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Enter a location in the input field and click the "Search" button to get the weather forecast.

Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `weather-api.js` with a valid API key from a weather service provider.
